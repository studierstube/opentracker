// Rounds a number to a specified number of digits.
// Number is the number you want to round.
// Num_digits specifies the number of digits to which you want to round number.
// If num_digits is greater than 0, then number is rounded to the specified number of decimal places.
// If num_digits is 0, then number is rounded to the nearest integer.
// Examples
//		ROUND(2.15, 1)		equals 2.2
//		ROUND(2.149, 1)		equals 2.1
//		ROUND(-1.475, 2)	equals -1.48
